Instances launched using Oracle Linux, CentOS, or Ubuntu images use an SSH key pair instead of a password to authenticate a remote user (see Security Credentials). A key pair consists of a private key and public key.
You keep the private key on your computer and provide the public key every time you launch an instance.<br>
Note that you don't have to provide public key if you are using a custom image and have already stored the public key in the image.
