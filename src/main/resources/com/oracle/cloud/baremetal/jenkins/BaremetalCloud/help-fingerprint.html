<div>You can get the key's fingerprint with OpenSSL command such like "openssl rsa -pubout -outform DER -in ~/.oraclebmc/bmcs_api_key.pem | openssl md5 -c".
And also when you upload the public key in the Console, the fingerprint is also automatically displayed there. It looks something like this: 12:34:56:78:90:ab:cd:ef:12:34:56:78:90:ab:cd:ef.
See the

  documentation for additional information.
